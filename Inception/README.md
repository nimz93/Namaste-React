1. What is Emmet ?
Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit for boosting HTML & CSS code writing.

With Emmet, you can type expressions (abbreviations) similar to CSS selectors and convert them into code fragment with a single keystroke. For example, this abbreviation:
PUSHED ITEMS TO BRANCH MAIN
ul#nav>li.item$*4>a{Item $}
...can be expanded into:

<ul id="nav">
    <li class="item1"><a href="">Item 1</a></li>
    <li class="item2"><a href="">Item 2</a></li>
    <li class="item3"><a href="">Item 3</a></li>
    <li class="item4"><a href="">Item 4</a></li>
</ul>

Emmet is built in visual studio code,
In Vs Code, Emmet abbreviation and snippet expansions are enabled by default in html, haml, pug, slim, jsx, xml, xsl, css, scss, sass, less and stylus files, as well as any language that inherits from any of the above like handlebars and php.
